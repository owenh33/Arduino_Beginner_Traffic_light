## Arduino Traffic light

A small project that simulates a junction with two sets of traffic lights as well as buttons for pedestrians that shortens the wait time



## requirements
-Arduino IDE, wires, 2 red LEDs, 2 green LEDs, 2 yellow LEDs, 2 push buttons, 6 220 ohm resistors and 2 10K ohm resistors

## Connection guide

# 1st junction

connect Red LED to pin 3 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground
connect Yellow LED to pin 4 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground
connect Green LED to pin 5 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground

connect button to pin 12 passing through a 10k ohm resistor and on to ground

# 2nd junction

connect Red LED to pin 8 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground
connect Yellow LED to pin 9 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground
connect Green LED to pin 10 via 220 ohm resistor and then ground

connect button to pin 13 passing through a 10k ohm resistor and on to ground

use the picture for help, unfortunately its a bit muddled but together with the info above you it should be understandable
